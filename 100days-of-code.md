**NOTES** 
This is only used as a note repo. there are no code that will be in used for coding but I might include some notes of code in this file repo. 

**#day1 of 100days of code**
did some basic HTMl and CSS to mess around with text and some designs.

**#day2 of 100days of code**
did my first project code named as FEM-qr-code. Challenge was given by front end mentor applied what I know inorder to complete it. only used HTML and CSS.
Because thats the only thing that I curently know. And I don't think C/C++ can be used in font-end, :D 

**#day3 of 100days of code**
im having some good issue with gradient but after using it im good with it. But now another problem occured that is grid in css. its easy to unders-stand but 
the main issue having is that I cant make the design right.

**#day4 of 100days of code**
just doing some review on onine video to get the things and design right still having the day3 issue. it still there. I'm so bad at this.
